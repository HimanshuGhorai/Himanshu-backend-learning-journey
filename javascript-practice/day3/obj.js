// What is an Object in JavaScript?
// An object is a collection of related data and functionality. Think of it as a "thing" with properties

const person = {
    name: "Himanshu",
    age: 23,
    city: "Kolkata"
};

// Q1️⃣ Create an object called student

const student = {
    name: "himanshu",
    rollNumber: 21,
    marks: 89
};

// Access object values

console.log(student.name);
console.log(student.rollNumber);
console.log(student.marks);
